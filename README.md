# Tkinter Number Guessing Game

This is a simple game that can guess the number you're thinking of.

## How to Play

To play this game, you'll need:

- Python 3 installed on your computer.
- The Tkinter module, a standard GUI library for Python. You can install it by running the command `pip install tkinter` in your terminal.

There are two ways to run this game:

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the folder where the repo is located and run the command:

    ```
    python number_guessing_game.py
    ```

2. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code from the `number_guessing_game.py` file into your preferred code editor or IDE and run it from there.

Once you run the game, a window will pop up with a welcome message and a button that says “Start”. Click on the button to begin the game.

The game will ask you to think of a number between 1 and 100. Then, it will ask you a series of questions to narrow down your number. Answer each question with either “Yes” or “No” by clicking on the corresponding button.

After a few questions, the game will guess your number and display it on the screen. It will also tell you how many questions it took to guess your number. You can then click on the “Play Again” button to start a new game, or click on the “Quit” button to exit the game.

- Efficient number guessing using a binary search algorithm.
