# Tkinter Number Guessing Game

This is a game that I created a long time ago. This is a simple game that can guess the number you're thinking of.

## How to Play

To play this game, you'll need:

- Python 3 installed on your computer.
- The Tkinter module, a standard GUI library for Python. You can install it by running the command `pip install tkinter` in your terminal.

you can run this game by following one of these steps:

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the folder where the repo is located and run the command:

    ```
    python number_guessing_game.py
    ```

2. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code from the `number_guessing_game.py` file into your preferred code editor or IDE and run it from there.

Once you run the game, a window will pop up and it will ask you a questions. To answer that you'd have to enter 'y' for yes and 'n' for no in the input field there.
